Contributing to keybrd
======================
We'd love for you to contribute to the keybrd project.

Improvement suggestions
-----------------------
We need to know what improvements to the keybrd library would help you create your keyboard design.
Before requesting an improvement, please check [planned_features list](doc/planned_features.md)

Submit improvement suggestions to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wolfv6/Keybrd/issues)
or [geekhack thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83599.0).
<!-- * The issue title should start with "suggestion:" followed by a descriptive title -->
* Provide a use case
* Explain why the improvement is useful
* Site other product examples where this improvement exists

Bug reports
-----------
A bug report is the first step in making the keybrd library work the way it's supposed to work.
Submit bug reports to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wolfv6/Keybrd/issues)
or [geekhack thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83599.0).

Please provide enough information so we can reproduce the bug behaviour!
* Complete sketch (copy & paste, attachment, or a link to the code)
* Screenshot or the exact text of error messages
* Describe the observed behavior and explain which behavior you expected
* Which controller your using
* Wiring details - how exactly have you connected the hardware (a photo's worth 1000 words)
* Arduino IDE version number
* keybrd library version number
* Any other information needed to reproduce the problem...

Code contributions
------------------
Unsure where to begin contributing to keybrd code?
You can start by looking through the improvement suggestions, bug reports, and [planned_features](doc/planned_features.md).

Git commit message style guide:
* Limit the first line to 72 characters summary
* Second line should be empty, followed by body of the commit message
* Use the imperative present tense (use "Add feature", not "Added feature", not "Adds feature")
* Reference an improvement suggestion, bug report, or planned_features
* Sometimes a bulleted list is a good format to convey the changes of a commit

User contributions
------------------
Any project requires various kinds of contributions to succeed.
A thriving project is more than a pile of code.
It's the packaging, explanation, outreach, and empathy of maintainers that make a good project great.

User Contributions can be in the form of:
* Blog - You have a fresh perspective of how the keybrd library works.
This makes you the perfect person to write an introductory blog explaining the project.
A healthy project needs the perspective of many people.
* Documentation - Suggest a clarification, simplification, correction, or other improvement.
We need the perspective of people new to the project to see these things.
Sometimes just changing a word or two makes a big difference.
* [Current user contributions](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83599.msg2223776#msg2223776) highlights contributions that are needed for the keybrd project's current stage of development.

Text file documentation style guide:
* Use Markdown with a .md suffix.
* "Underline" first-level (=) and second-level (-) headings (because easier to read in plain text).
* Capitalize first letter of headings (no extra capitalization in headings).

Submitting a pull request
-------------------------
Pull request is the preferred way to contribute code and documentation.
If you want to contribute some other way, please make a request in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wolfv6/Keybrd/issues).
