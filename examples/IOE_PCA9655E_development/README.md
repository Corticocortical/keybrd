The series of sketches in this folder where used to develop the Port_PCA9655E class in stages.
The folder numbers are ordered from fundamental to practical.

Each sketch was tested on a breadboard.  Breadboards hold:
* Teensy LC controller
* PCA9655E I/O expander

Pictures of the breadboard are in the folders.
