Tutorial 7a - using someone else's keybrd extension library
========================================================
The keybrd library contains the foundation classes for creating a keyboard firmware.
keybrd extension libraries extend the main keyboard library.

keybrd extension library names are prefixed by "keybrd_" and are listed in:
* [Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/InterfacingWithHardware#keyb) > find "keybrd"
* Arduino Library-Manager (Arduino IDE > Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > Filter your search: keybrd)

Instructions for installing a library are at:
