Tutorial 0 - Introduction
=========================
The first two tutorials are intended to be read in sequence:
* Tutorial 1 builds a breadboard keyboard and covers basic keyboard-hardware knowledge.
* Tutorial 2 covers basic keybrd-sketch knowledge needed to understand the remaining tutorials.

Tutorials 2 through 7 use the keyboard breadboard that was built in tutorial 1.
Tutorials from 3 up can be read in any order.
Tutorials from 8 up are advance topics about the keybrd library.

The tutorials assume the reader:
* is familiar with C++
* is new to Arduino, firmware, microcontrollers, and the internal workings of keyboards
