Tutorial 0 - Introduction
=========================
Tutorials 2 through 6 present an example sketch.
All the example sketches have 2 to 8 keys and run on a breadboard keyboard.

The first two tutorials are intended to be read in sequence:
 1. Breadboard keyboard
 2. Single-layer keybrd

Topics covered in tutorial 2 apply to all keybrd sketches.
The remaining tutorials can be read in any order.

The tutorials assume the reader:
* is familiar with C++
* is new to Arduino, firmware, controllers, and the internal workings of keyboards

<!-- todo -->
> All the tutorial sketches are tested on teensy 2.0 and PCA9655E-D I/O expander

> In July, the tutorial sketches will be changed to Teensy LC and MCP23018 I/O expander

> Some of the pictures and table values do not match the sketches, they will be updated after changing to Teensy LC

You will need a breadboard keyboard with a Teensy 2.0 controller to run the tutorial sketches.
If you use a different controller, you may have to change port classes.
If you already have a keyboard with an Arduino compatible controller, you can use that instead of a breadboard keyboard.
