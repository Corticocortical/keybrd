Tutorial 8c - sharing your keybrd sketch
========================================
keybrd sketches that use a keybrd extension library should be published in the extension library's examples directory.
keybrd sketches that do not use a keybrd extension library can be published anywhere.

Publishing and listing your keybrd sketch allows others to find your sketch.

Publish anywhere and list on Arduino Playground
-----------------------------------------------
Publish your sketch anywhere.  Some free places are:
* GitHub repository
* [GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/categories/gists/)
* [geekhack Making Stuff Together!](https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=117.0)

Then add a link and short description of your keybrd sketch to the [Arduino Playground keybrd page](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/keybrd) under "keybrd sketches".
Arduino playground is a wiki.
Links on how to edit the wiki are on the bottom left under "Participate".
