Tutorial 8a - using someone else's keybrd extension library
===========================================================
The keybrd library contains the classes needed for creating most keyboard firmware.
keybrd extension libraries extend the keyboard library with custom classes.

keybrd extension library names are prefixed by "keybrd_" and are listed in:
* [Arduino Playground](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/InterfacingWithHardware#keyb) > find "keybrd"
* Arduino Library-Manager (Arduino IDE > Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > Filter your search: keybrd)

Instructions for installing a library on Arduino IDE are at:
    http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

Once a keybrd extension library is installed, it's classes can be included in your sketch.
